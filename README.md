# my_dos_programs
I bult DOS programs and utilities way back and some were pretty good so I will store them here including source.

A few still run DOS, so these utilities may prove useful... Mike  

In the next few months I will recompile an ensure these programs still work before adding the complete list including all source for necessary TC files.  
I don't know if these file are of any interest to others but at least one might learn from them...
